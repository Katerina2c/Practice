Welcome to my dark side
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Welcome to my dark side
It's gonna be a long night
Oh, la, la, la, la

Welcome to my darkness, I been here a while
Clouding up the sunlight, hurting for a smile
Or something, but something always turns into nothing

Oh, I'll drain your life 'til there's
Nothing left but your blood shot eyes
Oh, I'll take my time 'til I show you how I feel inside

Welcome to my, welcome to my
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Welcome to my dark side
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I can be your reckless, you can be my stain
I can be your heartache, you can be my shame
When you're feeling reckless, when you're feeling chained
When there's nothing left but pain

Welcome to my dark side
We're gonna have a good time
Oh, la, la, la, la

Acting like I'm heartless, I do it all the time
That don't mean I'm scarless, that don't mean I'm fine
But you'll see, when someone else makes you this way

Oh, I'll drain your life 'til there's
Nothing left but your blood shot eyes
Oh, I'll take my time 'til I show you how I feel inside

Welcome to my, welcome to my
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Welcome to my dark side
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I can be your reckless, you can be my stain
I can be your heartache, you can be my shame
When you're feeling reckless, when you're feeling chained
When there's nothing left but pain

Welcome to my dark side
Welcome to my dark side
Welcome to my dark side
Welcome to my dark side

Welcome to my (ooh-ooh)
Welcome to my (ooh-ooh)
Welcome to my (ooh-ooh)
Welcome to my (ooh-ooh)

I can be your reckless, you can be my stain
I can be your heartache, you can be my shame
When you're feeling reckless, when you're feeling chained

Welcome to my dark side
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Welcome to my dark side
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
